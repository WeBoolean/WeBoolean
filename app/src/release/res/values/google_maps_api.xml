    https://console.developers.google.com/flows/enableapi?apiid=maps_android_backend&keyType=CLIENT_SIDE_ANDROID&r=9C:A4:09:99:88:A6:06:FC:28:B4:53:4E:C4:72:E9:F6:D9:23:0C:96%3Bweboolean.weboolean
    INSTRUCTIONS (by Raj):
        - Run the app
        - Look at LogCat. There should be 4 lines of red saying something along the lines of:
E/Google Maps Android API: Authorization failure.  Please see https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android-api/start for how to correctly set up the map.
E/Google Maps Android API: In the Google Developer Console (https://console.developers.google.com)
                   Ensure that the "Google Maps Android API v2" is enabled.
                   Ensure that the following Android Key exists:
                    API Key: AIzaSyCVN3xVDMD3S5TU81uqy7SqTZvVwI
                    Android Application (<cert_fingerprint>;<package_name>): 9C:A4:10:99:88:A6:05:FC:28:B4:53:4E:C4:72:E9:F6:D9:23:0C:96;weboolean.weboolean

        - You will have a different number there. I have the 9C...96, you will have something different. Replace [PASTE IN HERE] with you string.
         The final version should be along the lines of the URL at the top.

https://console.developers.google.com/flows/enableapi?apiid=maps_android_backend&keyType=CLIENT_SIDE_ANDROID&r=[PASTE IN HERE]%3Bweboolean.weboolean
        - Copy and paste that string into a web browser and follow instructions
        - Rename the key to yournameKey so that we know who's is who's.

    Once you have your key, replace the "google_maps_key"
    string in this file. (currently mine is in there)

    -->
    <string name="google_maps_key" templateMergeStrategy="preserve" translatable="false">YOUR_KEY_HERE</string>
